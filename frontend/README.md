### GoRyde Capstone Project

###  Project Title
**GoRyde - It is a Ride Booking and Management Platform**

<h3>## Project Idea</h3>
GoRyde is a platform that helps users book and manage rides easily. It will have a unique features which make GoRyde apart from other apps,

1.For instance, when traveling from home  to the office, users can activate the auto pickup mode to schedule a taxi at the precise time they need. This functionality guarantees clients get to the office right on time.

2.By subscribing to the travel anywhere Membership, users can travel throughout the city at any time, anywhere, users can enjoy Upto 7 Rides journey per a day throughout the city .

3.If Users Face a difficulty with app or with Divers, They can Raise “Complaint”.App Agencies will find the issue, Solve the Issue within few Hours

4.We Welcome pets in taxis and on bikes where we promote a pet-friendly environment.




## Project Description

**Day 4:**
Develop the Usercard component with fields for profile photo, name, email, phone number, and address.
Ensure the component is styled properly and responsive across devices.

**Day 5:**
Build the user profile page with a clear layout to showcase user details.
Implement state management to handle data display efficiently.

**Day 6-7:**
Develop the backend API to manage user data, including CRUD operations.
Create database models for user information and set up secure routes for data fetching.


**Week 2: Admin Portal and Additional Features**

**Day 8-9:**
